First, I made a google form to collect comments from friends. Since it's the final exam time, everyone is quite busy so I'm not sure that when I finish this project everyone will have time to try it out. So when I just finished a simple web notes app, I sent you a link to try it out (instead of waiting for it to finish, it can be downloaded on your phone). The test1 image below is the image I collected when letting you guys try it out.

1. After receiving the feedback, I updated the pie chart so that it updated properly with the information.
2. In addition, I also added service worker and manifest.
